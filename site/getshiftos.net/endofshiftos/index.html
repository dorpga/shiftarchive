<h1>ShiftOS</h1>

<h3>Project status: Undetermined.</h3>

<p>Hey there. Michael here. The project status of ShiftOS has gone from deprecated to undetermined. I feel like working on the game however I'm probably going to be releasing builds less often and I'll probably be a bit less vocal about it.</p>

<p>I have made a video explaining what's going on with the project.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'll most likely set up a proper website on this server when I feel it's ready to bring the game back to the public. Keep checking back for updates.</p>
